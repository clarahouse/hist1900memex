question: what is the most powerful thing you learned in this course 

while attending the lectures and doing the readings i think the most powerful thing i learned was a network of different things. 
- how to work on obsidian and use the different commands on my computer to my benefit. 
i am not the biggest tech person but even still this course made me appritate and look more curiously into the world of networks. 
i learned about the internet i use everyday, how it was creatyed and who created it. the differnces between what the internet does along with what web pages are used for. 

The journey between two sources 
internet & the web
- the web represents the start of a process of cultural change (internet history)
- the internet is the network of connected computers that the web is working on (the web are the pages you see when youre on your device and youre online)
	 - emails and files travel across 
persistence of the internet, cold war beginings influenced its design as a decentralized communication network

meduium and messages 
- medium can sometimes be more important than the message 
	- internet: the net is about connecting messages 
	- we let our minds into these medias 
	- the meduium holds these messages and takes them to where they are supposed to go connecting in a network 
	- the two work together to sufficiently get the message across to its prefered audience 

how did ancient eypgtians decide what was important and what wasnt? we wouldnt know without clay tablets that recorded theirt history, their everyday life. 
- people living back in ancient mesopotamia didnt have paper or phones they can jot their notes down into instead they used clay tablets they made themselves to record what they thiought was important at the time, and now we veiw it with historical meaning. that this came from a civilization way beyond our time and this is what they used to do it. 
humans used many different things to record their daily activities or to write stories to tell to younger children. we see it now preserved in muesums holding onto the last bit of knowledge we have left of a civilization before us.

The evolution and development of library catalouges from clay tablets 
 - in early stages catalouging was local and indivdual library practice 
 - each library had their own constructed catalouge 
 - management of aquired knwoledge is carried out in libraries 
 - libraries are the treasurew houses of books 
 - libraries offer tools and techniques for selecting, ocating, and retrieving materials 
	 - two main tools used:
	 - classification - helps arranged docs in a systematic order 
	 - catalogue - helps organize, identify and located required docs

memex 
- small part of interior of the memex is devoted to storage 
- other half to mechanism 
- most of thememex contents purchased on microfilm
- mircrofilm 
	- type of way to compact storage 

associative indexing 
- affords an immediate step 
- basic idea of which is a proivison wherby an item may be caused at will to select immediately and automatically another 
- ^essential feature of the memex 
the process of tying two items together is important

all together 
- all the steps in absorbing material of the record proceed through our senses 
- tactile when we touch keys 
- oral when we speak/listen 
- visual when reading
