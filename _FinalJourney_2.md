question: did you meet your goals for this course? Why or why not? (and also perhaps, how?)

At the begining of this course i did not know what i was going to be learning, i had no idea i was going to be learning how to use different apps to create my own network of information i could go back at anytime and look at. 
My personal goals at the begining were to pass but as the course went on my goals shifted towards wanting to create my own network. Rooting from different sources creating a tree with with information and branches of notes from these sources. 
Personally i still have a long way to go and yet understand every different possiblity i have with my devices but taking this course helped me understand the world within my devices that are in arms reach. 
by using obsidian i am able to connect my notes together and tie in other notes that corrolate with what is being explained in said note. 
for example if i am doing reserach on a project and its asking me about how Indigenous Canadians lived before Euro settlers came over i can start by making a seperate note on who the european settlers are, and what was their purpose for coming over onto Inidgenous soil, what acts led to the colonialization of Indigenous people and why Canada Day is basically a holiday celebrating colonial views and acts. With these spider web like ideas i am able to create this world of notes connected to eachother sharing the same goal but ultimatly giving me more knowledge on the topic i am researching.
