question: what is the most powerful thing you learned in this course 

while attending the lectures and doing the readings i think the most powerful thing i learned was a network of different things. 
- how to work on obsidian and use the different commands on my computer to my benefit. 
i am not the biggest tech person but even still this course made me appritate and look more curiously into the world of networks. 
i learned about the internet i use everyday, how it was creatyed and who created it. the differnces between what the internet does along with what web pages are used for.
