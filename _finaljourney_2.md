question: did you meet your goals for this course? Why or why not? (and also perhaps, how?)

At the begining of this course i did not know what i was going to be learning, i had no idea i was going to be learning how to use different apps to create my own network of information i could go back at anytime and look at. 
My personal goals at the begining were to pass but as the course went on my goals shifted towards wanting to create my own network. Rooting from different sources creating a tree with with information and branches of notes from these sources. 
Personally i still have a long way to go and yet understand every different possiblity i have with my devices but taking this course helped me understand the world within my devices that are in arms reach.
