what is going on in your head?
what is carrying you? what is moving you to get the message
you decide what is important

Cave Dots
	- context changes the message 
	- the caves were diffcult to discover through which leads the information hard to reach 

The Medium is the Message 
	- medium can sometimes be more important than the message 
	- internet: the net is about connecting messages 
	- we let our minds into these medias 

medium: something that carries something else 
	- what carries you 

classification: relfects and directs our feelings

Media found through communitcation
- extending our human cognition
- anicent mesopotamia 
- clay tablets 
- wax tablets
- humans create these artifacts that carry information to us about the past and how people lived 
- greek, romans 
ex.  - The Code of Hammurabi, Mose and the 10 Commandments, Justinians Code 
(the important of these messages/ these writing systems mark the power)
- the medium itself keas to a permanence

cuneiform one of the oldest forms of writing

libraries: built as a place of importance 
	- holds infomration about the past 

corrleations with sound did not exist at first 
	- developed from several factors 

Mari
- third millenium city 
- arranged arounf cyclical trade with Greece and India 
- archieve with over 3000 letters written in scripts 

Rome 
- writing on wax tablets (more sofisticated media)
- archieves and library 

wrap up:
	- medium is as important as the message 
	- medium puts a different spin/colour on the message 
	- how we classify media/messages has implications for power, control, and discipline 
		- relfects and directs what youre thinking
		- how it extends our ablities to think and how we percieve the world
	- infrastructure for writinfg spills out and has impacts on society 
	- internet is like a library
	- books are mediums
	- no natural way to organize a library

moveable type:
- Korean moveablle type from 1377 used for the jikji
- made from seramic 
- fucntions in a way a character would, each hangul letter/ symbol can move in different formats or different ways
- the Korean language is made up from constants and vowels

Melvil Dewey (1851-1931)
- devlops a organization system for libraries
- comes up with a way to organzie the worlds knowledge whether or not he has that book
- Dewey decimal system
	- if new ideas emerge we can always add another decimal to slot the book in where it ought to be 
phliosophy, theology, governemnt, philology(language), nature, history 

"The study of invisible writings was a new discipline made available by the discovery of the bi-directional nature of Library-Space. The thaumic mathematics are complex, but boil down to the fact that all books, everywhere, affect all other books. This is obvious: books inspire other books written in the future, and cite books written in the past" - Pratchett

Library of Congress systems
- what we have and how can we help people get it/find it
- reflects bias congress intresets 

Emergency of ditital computer 
- happens in a context through people who were educated with these biases in mind 



the Memex:
- the computer coukd change how we organize knowledge 
- this is a medium change over 
- a document might self organize and forms its oen connections 
- we can call this the 'bidirectional link'

1965: Hypertext
- project Xanadoo did not happen 

wrap up:
- no natural way dor documents/ info ti be organized 
- there is no scheme 


invention og thr digital computer happens noyt all that long after tjese massive reorganizations 
- the ditization ofg knowledge is built by people for whom these categorizations/classifications of the world are normalized
