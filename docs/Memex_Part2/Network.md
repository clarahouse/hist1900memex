-   Innovation hubs
-   Something that connects people up
-   Rail networks, water networks, sewer networks (London swimming in shit) - the idea to create sewer lines
-   No matter where wires are, describes a vision, telephone lines connecting us together
-  "powerful men" controlling the electrons

First Bell Company 1875
-   First telephone exchange operated by Western Union's telephone subsidery
-   First women central office operator: 1878, Emma Nutt
-   The idea of assigning unique numbers to subscribers - suggested 1879


One of the first automatic exchanges

-   The Strowger automatic exchange - 1892
-   A lot of under handing from competing groups
-   He is rattled by this so he invents a device that cannot cut his line from receiving a call
-   Shifting work off of others

Takes 20 years before automatic exchanges made any impact

-   People had to learn how to be on the phone
-   Just cause tech exist doesn’t mean that it is socially impactive

First two decades of telephony - very slow uptake, wasn’t easy for people to use/ jump right into

National Bell becomes American Bell

Brings in Theodor Vail - cousin of Alfred Vail

-   His strategy was to buy back all the smaller groups
-   Hubbard and Bell are out
-   The agreement with Western Union still in force
-   Vail is changing his approach, buying loco small companies

Breaks agreement

Long distance line gets established

-   1884 American Bell establishes long distance line between NY and Boston
-   Bell is making money!  hand over fist, even though rest of economy is in a depression
-   Patents just won were about to expire
-   Vail strategy

-   Shady acts
-   Cut rates so far the other companies are driven out

The wealthy are on the bell system which gave them access to the AT&T long distance line, rest on the cheaper system

America land of competition

-   Long distance line was very expensive

-   Long distance telephony was central to Bells plan to survive the expiration of its patents
-   Vail was invincible
